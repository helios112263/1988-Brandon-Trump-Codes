Vice President George Bush has fought off a tougher than expected primary fight and stands at the head of the Republican Party. Emerging from a crowded field of competitors, Delaware Senator Joe Biden uses his youthful energy and determination to forge a new path for the struggling Democratic Party.</p><p>Despite Reagan’s popularity, the litany of scandals surrounding his administration such as Iran-Contra, and the growing economic divide between the wealthy and the middle class that have been interpreted as the failure of Reaganomics have caused many Americans to turn their backs on Reagan, and look to both the Democrats and the Republicans to show America a new way forward, either in the form of the more moderate Bush or via the liberal views of Biden. While it is clear that the Reagan Era seems to be coming to an end, it is unclear exactly who and what will take that place to lead America into a new decade and forge its policies for the next century.</p><p>Will America elect Vice President Bush as a sign of approval of Reagan’s third term or will they give the fresh, new age politics of Senator Biden a shot?</p></li></ul></p></div>\n",

In the Senate, Biden has positioned himself as part of the mainstream of the Democratic Party with a moderate reputation, and has gained national attention as the Chair of the Judiciary Committee and as an outspoken voice on foreign policy.</p><p>Having declined a run in 1984 and passed over for VP that year, Biden announced his candidacy for the 1988 election and quickly became a frontrunner for the nomination, eventually winning the primary with a combination of his energetic and fiery speeches and warm, folksy personality. While Biden does have some scandals and has a tendency to make gaffes on the campaign trail, there seems to be little question that Biden is a man made for the presidency, and if he is able to solidly unify the Democrats behind him and take George Bush to task for the malarkies of the Reagan Administration, Biden will be the man taking the oath of office next January.</p></div>",
